# Scenarios

For a leadership workshop, the excercises are scenarios, where people can practice going through them, either reading and responding themselves, or practicing with a partner. 

We'd like to develop scenarios that give workshop participants the chance to practice the things they have just learned in a module. For example, for the 'Giving and receiving feedback' module, you would want practice scenarios where you could practice giving feedback to someone and practice receiving difficult feedback. 

Like any skill, only practice helps you get better! These scenarios in a workshop setting give you the space for that practice. 

## Scenario format

Each scenario has its own page. This is an example. 

For each scenario include:

**Skill**: List the skill being practiced  
**Format**: Is this an individual, paired or group exercise  
**Directions**: Are there any particular directions?  
**Time:**: How much time should participants spend on this exercise? How much on the scenario and how much on the reflection questions?  
**Scenario**: The story of the scenario  
**Reflection questions**: What questions might you ask yourself or others after the scenario?
